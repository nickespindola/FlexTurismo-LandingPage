## About
Flex Turismo is a landing Page of a fictitious tourism company.

The website was based and developed with the help of the course “Introduction to creating websites with HTML5 and CSS3” by Digital Innovation One.

Throughout the development of the project, there was a lot of exercise of the Flexbox properties, this being the first work I did with this property.
The website is also fully responsive, efficiently adapted for mobile platforms.
